/**
 * Claude Code UserPromptSubmit hook: runs on EVERY query in Claude Code.
 *
 * Claude Code pipes hook input as JSON on stdin ({session_id, transcript_path,
 * prompt, ...}). We profile the session transcript; when the context is lean
 * we print nothing (zero noise, near-zero cost). When it crosses thresholds we
 * emit additionalContext with targeted hygiene guidance — so every query in a
 * heavy session gets nudged toward a leaner context automatically.
 *
 * Registered by `context-doctor install` under hooks.UserPromptSubmit in
 * ~/.claude/settings.json; removed by `context-doctor uninstall`.
